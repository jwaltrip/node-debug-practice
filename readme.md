#### Setup
Fork, clone, debug index.js 
#### Do
 1.  Global variables.
   * global variables are very dangerous. You may have no idea where they are declared or what code assigned to the variable
   * debug index.js. What is the value of the mysteryvalue variable.

   > `mysteryvalue = 'debugging is funn'`

 2. Loops
   * debugging a loop may not be ideal if you have to observe the entire loop execute
   * debug functions.js. What is the value of startingNumber immediately before the loop executes? after the loop executes. 

   > Immediately before the loop executes `startingNumber = 3426.5`
   > Immediately after the loop executes `startingNumber = 4425.5`

 3. Function calls
   * It may be difficult to determine what code called a function.
   * debug functions.js.  Where is this function being called from? 

   > Line 93 in `underscore.js`
